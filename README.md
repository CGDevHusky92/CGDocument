CGDocument
==========

This is a library of custom document classes I have started putting together starting with an attribute view controller. So far I have an object that can correctly parse a given text file with specific attributes throughout a document and then display it in a text view. I will post an example document later. Helps disperse attributes through a better display with less code.
